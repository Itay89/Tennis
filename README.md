#### - Pre-processing stage:
- Created data frames by combining multiple data sources.
- Data analysis in order to find the best features for the task.

#### - Compared multiple ML algorithms predicting results with each other and with baseline predictors.
#### - Analysis of results and fine tuning for the best Hyper-parameters.
#### - Implemented robust model that achieved better results than similar projects from Stanford.
#### - The model achieved around 10% improvement in comparison to the baseline models on close matches.
